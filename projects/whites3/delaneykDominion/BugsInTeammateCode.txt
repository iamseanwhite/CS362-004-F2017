1)	Smithy - The bug was in the line 
		for (i = 0; i <= 3; i++), 
	where the original ‘<’ was changed to ‘<=’.

2)	Adventure - In line 
		while(z>=0){
	'z' should be 'z-1'

3)	Remodel - The line that compares costs,
		if ((getCost(state->hand[currentPlayer][choice1]) + 2) > getCost(choice2))
	does not work. A more accurate comparison would be:
		if ((getCost(state->hand[currentPlayer][choice1]) ) < getCost(choice2) - 2)

3.1)	The Remodel function also allows you to trash the remodel card itself, which is 
	not allowed in the game.

4)	discardCard - DiscardCount does not increment even though card was not trashed. 
	The card is only placed in the playedCards pile.

5)	isGameOver - Game should be over when three supply piles are emptied. 
	This does not occur if one of the piles has index 25 or 26 because the for loops 
	only goes up to 24, not 26.
